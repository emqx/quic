# Examples

This directory contains 2 examples, as well as lux test code.

## Example 1, qt.erl

The first example contains a server and a client, the client has a rudimentary
CLI which makes it possible to play around with various combinations of
connect, start_stream, close_stream etc.
Start the server as

```
$ make server``
```

and in another terminal, the client as
```
$ make client
```

In the client terminal, start the CLI by `qt:c()` and then experiment
with issuing various commands:


```
$ make all
......
$ make client
Eshell V13.0.4  (abort with ^G)
1> qt:c().
--> connect.
Connection # 1
--> {stream, 1}.
Sent negotiate data
Stream # 1
--> {ping, 1}.
Got pong 1
ok
--> {close_stream, 1}.
ok
-->

```

Also, it's interesting is to experiment with various variants of CTL-Z and
CTL-C on both the server and the client.


## Example 2, rev.erl

This is an example trying to emulate the case with a server and a client where
the client resides behind a NAT device, thus forcing all connections to go from
"down" to "up"
Once a quicer connections has been established going "up", all subsequent
streams in both directions are shared on top of the same connection.
See the code for run instructions


## lux

Lux is an amazing `expect` like test tool (written in Erlang). It's available at
https://github.com/hawk/lux
To run the lux tests in this example, download, build and install `lux` and
execute

```
$ make lux
```
